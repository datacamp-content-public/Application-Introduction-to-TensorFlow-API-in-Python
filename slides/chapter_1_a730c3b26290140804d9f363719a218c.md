Welcome to this chapter on understanding basics of TensorFlow. In this chapter we will learn about constants in tensorflow. We will also learn about how to run a basic TensorFlow program by creating sessions.

## Constants in TensorFlow

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "4f7b737f4c"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
Input Code:
```
# Import the TensorFlow library
import tensorflow as tf

# Define constants
a = tf.constant(4)
b = tf.constant(6)

# Perform multiplication on a and b
c = tf.multiply(a,b)
print(c)
```
{{1}}
Output:
```
Tensor("Mul:0", shape=(), dtype=int32)
```
{{2}}

`@script`
Let us look at how to create constants in TensorFlow.
First, we import the TensorFlow library.
Next, we  define two constants, a and b using a tensorflow constant.

Further, we define c as multiplication of constants a and b by using multiply.

Now, when we execute this code, we get an output as the shape of the tensor and not the multiplication of the values of a and b.
This is because we did not initiate a tensorflow session. We will look at how to do that in the next slide.

## Creating a TensorFlow Session

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "f4b7ac17d1"
```

`@part1`
Input Code:
```
# Import the TensorFlow library
import tensorflow as tf

# Define constants
a = tf.constant(4, name = 'a')
b = tf.constant(6, name = 'b')

# Perform multiplication on a and b
c = tf.multiply(a,b, name = 'c')

#Create a TensorFlow Session
sess = tf.Session()
print(sess.run(c))
sess.close()
```
{{1}}
Output:
```
24
```
{{2}}


`@part2`
Interpretation of Code:

`@script`
Alright, so the code remains same as earlier, but instead of directly going for printing c, we need to start a tensorflow session, and then print c within a session run.
We do see a small change in the code from the previous slide. We see that the constants are explicitly named. If they are not, tensorflow will name them itself.
After all commands are done, it is advisable to close the session by issuing a close command.

The image on the right shows how tensorflow interprets the code. The constants a and b are defined as nodes. 
These two nodes come together as a multiplication in a new node - named c.
Now, we see the output of the code is multiplication of constants a and b.

We can avoid using the close command by using a with statement, which we will see in the next slide.

## Running a TensorFlow session in a With statement

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "f7efaa8d7f"
```

`@part1`
Input Code:
```
# Import the TensorFlow library
import tensorflow as tf

# Define constants
a = tf.constant(4, name = 'a')
b = tf.constant(6, name = 'b')

# Perform multiplication on a and b
c = tf.multiply(a,b, name = 'c')

#Create a TensorFlow Session
with tf.Session() as sess:
     print(sess.run(c))
```
{{1}}
Output:
```
24
```
{{2}}


`@part2`



`@script`
So, using a with statement, we can avoid using the close command and also reduce the number of lines.

## What more can be done with constants?

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "e7078c4a9e"
```

`@part1`
Input Code:
```
import tensorflow as tf

a=tf.constant([1,3], name='a')
b=tf.constant([[1,8],[-4,3]], name='b')

c=tf.multiply(a,b, name = 'c')

with tf.Session() as sess:
     print(sess.run(c))
```
{{1}}
Output:
```
[[ 1 24]
 [-4  9]]
```
{{3}}


`@part2`
Constants can be used to define arrays. TensorFlow has broadcasting capability similar to NumPy.

`@script`
What more can be done with constants? Well, we can pass arrays of different shapes using a constant. We can also perform operations between these constants with arrays. Here, we define 2 arrays and then multiply them. We can see that TensorFlow has broadcasting capability similar to NumPy.

`@script`
Alright, in this chapter we learnt about TensorFlow constants and creating a session. Next, we will see the different types of mathematics and some advanced data types in TensorFlow.
