Welcome to this chapter on understanding basics of TensorFlow. In this chapter we will learn about constants in tensorflow. We will also learn about how to run a TensorFlow program by creating sessions.

## Constants in TensorFlow

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "4f7b737f4c"
```

`@part1`
Input Code:
```
# Import the TensorFlow library
import tensorflow as tf

# Define constants
a = tf.constant(4)
b = tf.constant(6)

# Perform multiplication on a and b
c = tf.multiply(a,b)
print(c)
```



Output:
```
Tensor("Mul:0", shape=(), dtype=int32)
```


`@part2`



`@script`
Let us look at how to create constants in TensorFlow.
First, we import the TensorFlow library by writing import tensorflow as tf.
Next, we  define two constants, a and b using tf dot constant.
.
Further, we define c as multiplication of constants a and b by using tf dot multiply.

Now, when we execute this code, we get an output as the shape of the tensor and not the multiplication of the values of a and b.
This is because we do not initiate a session of tensorflow. We will look at that in the next slide.

## Creating a TensorFlow Session

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "f4b7ac17d1"
```

`@part1`
Input Code:
```
# Import the TensorFlow library
import tensorflow as tf

# Define constants
a = tf.constant(4, name = 'a')
b = tf.constant(6, name = 'b')

# Perform multiplication on a and b
c = tf.multiply(a,b, name = 'c')

#Create a TensorFlow Session
sess = tf.Session()
print(sess.run(c))
sess.close()
```

Output:
```
24
```


`@part2`
Interpretation of Code:

`@script`
Alright, so the code remains same as earlier, but instead of directly going for print c, we need to start a tensorflow session by using to tf dot Session, and then print c withing a session run.
We do see a small change in the code. We see that the constants are explicitly named. If they are not, tensorflow will name them itself.
After all commands are done, it is advisable to close the session by issuing a close command.

The image on the right shows how tensorflow interprets the inputs. The constants a and b are defined as nodes. 
These two nodes come together as a multiplication in a new node - named c.


 We can avoid using the close command by using a with statement, which we will see in the next slide.

## Running a TensorFlow session in a With statement

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "f7efaa8d7f"
```

`@part1`
Input Code:
```
# Import the TensorFlow library
import tensorflow as tf

# Define constants
a = tf.constant(4, name = 'a')
b = tf.constant(6, name = 'b')

# Perform multiplication on a and b
c = tf.multiply(a,b, name = 'c')

#Create a TensorFlow Session
with tf.Session() as sess:
     print(sess.run(c))
```

Output:
```
24
```


`@part2`



`@script`
So, using a with statement, we can reduce the number of lines, and avoid using the sess dot close.

## Final Slide

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "ebf58194f0"
```

`@script`
Okay, in this chapter we learnt about TensorFlow constants and creating a session. Next, we will see the different types of mathematics and some advanced data types in TensorFlow.
