Welcome to this chapter on understanding basics of TensorFlow. In this chapter we will learn about constants and variables. We will also learn about how to how to run a TensorFlow program by creating sessions.

## Constants in TensorFlow

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ff9ea9a585"
```

`@part1`
Input Code:
```
# Import the TensorFlow library
import tensorflow as tf

# Define constants
a = tf.constant(4)
b = tf.constant(6)

# Perform multiplication on a and b
c = tf.multiply(a,b)
print(c)
```



Output:
```
Tensor("Mul:0", shape=(), dtype=int32)
```


`@script`
Let us look at how to create constants and variables in TensorFlow.
First, we import the TensorFlow library by writing import tensorflow as tf.
Next, we  define two constants, a and b. we define a = 4 and b = 6.
Further, we define "c" as multiplication of constants a and b.

Now, when we execute this code, we get an output as the shape of the tensor and not the multiplication of the values of a and b. we will look at that in the next slides.

## Interpretation of Code

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "fcb8b6d0c4"
```

`@script`
This is how tensorflow interprets the inputs. The constants a and b are defined as nodes. If no names are given, tf will name them automatically as x and y, but in our case we have the names defined.
These two nodes come together as a multiplication in a new node - named c.
Next, we will look at how to create a tf session and get the value of c as output.
